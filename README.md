# Supply chain DApp
I had a go at making some smart contracts for my undergradute dissertation. I was exploring the concept of using a blockchain to log item provenance, to enable/simplify and encourage reuse of items in the build environment. 

My contracts were created and tested using the Remix IDE, writen in Solidity.
